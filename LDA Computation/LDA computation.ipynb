    "Topic modeling is a method for unsupervised classification of documents, similar to clustering on numeric data, which finds some natural groups of items (topics) even when we’re not sure what we’re looking for.\n",

    "\n",
    "What we want to figure out are the words in different topics, as shown in the table below. Each row in the table represents a different topic and each column a different word in the corpus. Each cell contains the probability that the word(column) belongs to the topic(row).\n",

    "We can sort the words with respect to their probability score.\n",

    "The top x words are chosen from each topic to represent the topic. If x = 10, we’ll sort all the words in topic1 based on their score and take the top 10 words to represent the topic.\n",
    "This step may not always be necessary because if the corpus is small we can store all the words in sorted by their score.\n",
    "Alternatively, we can set a threshold on the score. All the words in a topic having a score above the threshold can be stored as its representative, in order of their scores.\n"
